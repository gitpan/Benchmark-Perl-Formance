Perl-Formance

This benchmark suite tries to run some stressful programs and outputs
values that you can compare against other runs of this suite,
e.g. with other versions of Perl, modified compile parameter, or
another set of dependent libraries.

=head1 BUGS

=head2 No invariant dependencies

This distribution only contains the programs to run the tests and
according data. It uses a lot of libs from CPAN with all their
dependencies but it does not contain invariant versions of those used
dependency libs.

That means your performance output may change just because a far away
lib that you upgraded in the meantime changes its performance.

If total invariance is important to you, you are responsible to
provide that invariant environment by yourself. You could, for
instance, create a local CPAN mirror with CPAN::Mini and never upgrade
it. Then use that mirror for all your installations of Benchmark::Perl::Formance.

On the other side the current behaviour could be used to track the
performance of your installation over time by continuously upgrading
from CPAN. I always upgrade from CPAN whatever I can; so I consider
that a feature.
